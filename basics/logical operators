 Logical operators: (and,or,not)
1. and Operator: If both operators are true , result will be true 
               If the first operator is False, returns false without evaluating the second operand
2. or Operator :the or operator returns True if at least one operand is true.
               if the first operand is true, returns true without evaluating the second operand.
3. not Operator :the not operator returns the opposite boolean value of its operand. 
for ex-  result = not True # This will be False
